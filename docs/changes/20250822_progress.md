- Added Tumbling analysis and planning DTOs with adapters and tests for Step1.
## 2025-08-22 09:19 JST [naruse]
- Integrated tumbling and BasedOn analysis into pipeline with metadata builders and revised DDL adapter.
## 2025-08-22 18:30 JST [assistant]
- Removed temporary QueryAnalyzer; merged analysis into existing visitor and generators.
## 2025-08-22 18:39 JST [assistant]
- Addressed review comments: Live as TABLE, cleaned DAG edges, ensured HB metadata, and added unit-based timeframe checks with tests.
## 2025-08-22 19:25 JST [assistant]
- Refactored query builders into a single core with role traits and operation specs, adjusted input hints, and updated tests.
## 2025-08-22 20:35 JST [assistant]
- Streamlined HB metadata by clearing value shape and marking as Stream, tightened entity model validation, and ensured QuerySpec target IDs are nonempty.
## 2025-08-22 20:46 JST [assistant]
- Added registration defaulting keyed entities to tables with heartbeat forced to stream, implemented schema hash validation, and verified BasedOn joins in builders.

## 2025-08-22 21:19 JST [assistant]
- Verified registrar defaults tables for keyed entities while heartbeats remain streams.
- Ensured schema hash validator skips heartbeats and caches per POCO.
- Confirmed builders expand BasedOn joins with open/close bounds across roles.
## 2025-08-22 21:39 JST [assistant]
- Added core builder and registrar tests, schema diff validation, topic name resolver, and Rocks cache checks.
## 2025-08-22 13:15 JST [assistant]
- Added schema hash type/nullability coverage, handled missing role safely, and verified topic id fallback.
## 2025-08-22 22:25 JST [assistant]
- Sanitized topic naming with appsettings override, preserved default topic configs on partial binds, parsed long retentions invariantly, and included nullability in schema validation.
## 2025-08-22 22:56 JST [assistant]
- Applied topic configuration to admin topic creation and added unit tests for resolver precedence, retention, registrar defaults, and Rocks scope.
